# Exploring the Limits Of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text To Text Transformer

> This paper explores how we can exploit transfer learning to fine-tune a general transformer trained on the C4 Dataset in order to beat state of the art datasets and benchmarks.

## Dataset

### C4

C4 is a short acronym for the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus and is a cleaned version of the Common Crawl Web. They implemented the following filters.

- **Punctuation** : Only lines that ended in a terminal punctuation were kept
- **Minimum Length** : Pages had to have more than 3 sentences and at least 5 lines
- **Obsence Content** : They removed pages with words that were known to be associated with pornographic or obsene content
- **Irrelevant Content** : They removed all mentions of lorem ipsum content
- **Non rendered Pages** : Pages that had warnings indicating that javascript needed to be removed. They also removed all code pages 
- **Citations**: All citations were removed 
- **Policy Notices** : All lines containing any privacy policies 

They also performed a further de-duplication on any three-sentence span occuring more than once in the dataset. This dataset helped in boosting performance across the benchmarks.

We can make the following observations 

1. C4 Filtering helps a lot - we get a lot more performance for a significantly smaller dataset. Without the filtering, a model trained on the Common Crawl gets the worst performance.

2. Domain Specific text corpus does increase the performance of specific models (Eg. using the RealNews-like data set for pre-training conferred an increase from 68.16 to 73.72 on the Exact Match score for ReCoRD, a data set that measures reading comprehension on news articles. )

> A drawback to only pre-training on a single domain is that the resulting data sets are often substantially smaller. Similarly, while the WebText-like variant performed as well or better than the C4 data set in our baseline setting, the Reddit-based filtering produced a data set that was about 40× smaller than C4 despite being based on 12× more data from Common Crawl

### Unsupervised Dataset Experiments

The atuhors of the paper performed a good amount of experimentation with the data avaliable on hand. 

![Experiments](/t5_unsupervised_exploration.png)

Notably, there were these 4 hyper-parameters that they explored to see how it affected the final model performance.

- `Task`: What should the model do?
- `Corruption Strategy` : How should we make the task harder?
- `Corruption Rate` : How much of the data should we modify?
- `Corrupted Span Length` : How much continous chunks of data should we modify?

#### Task

They compared three separate tasks 
- Prefix Language Modelling : Pass in some text and get the model to predict the rest 
- Masked Language Modelling : Pass in some text with some chunks of it masked, get the model to predict the complete sequen
- Deshuffling : Mix up the order of the words, get the model to unscramble the sentence

We can see that in general the BERT-style masked language modelling task performs the best out of the three tasks and the best corruption strategy can be seen below.

#### Corruption Rate 

Corruption Rate mainly deals with how much of the text do we remove and mask. They experimented with a few different options

![Corruption Rates](/t5_corruption_rate.png)

We can see here that it performs best at the 10-20% range where we remove 10-20% of all the tokens inside the span itself.

#### Corruption Continous Span

![Corruption Span](/t5_corruption_span.png)

The last bit of experimentation was on how many continous tokens should constitute a single span. Prior to this, the approach the authors used was simpler - just make an i.i.d. decision for each input token as to whether to corrupt it or not. 

> For example, if we are processing a sequence of 500 tokens and we have specified that 15% of tokens should be corrupted and that there should be 25 total spans, then the total number of corrupted tokens would be 500×0.15 = 75 and the average span length would be 75/25 = 3.

### Multi-Task Learning in the Dataset

There were two main questions that they were curious about 

1. How should we configure a dataset for multi-task learning : How to mix this?
2. How much can we repeat the data for under-represented data points

#### Multi-Task Example Mixing

When thinking about configuring a dataset for multi-task learning, the key difficulty is the mixture of examples. There are a few ways we can do this 

- **Proportional Mixing**: We sample from the example based on the percentage of the dataset the example comprises.
- **Proportional Mixing with Artifical Limit** : We sample based on the percentage of the dataset the example comrpises and we set an artifical limit of $K$.
- **Temperature-Scaled Mixing** : We convert the probabilities by raising the probability to `1/r` and then renormalizing the rates. We set an artifical limit of $K$ and sample from the dataset using these probabilities.

![Multitask Learning](/t5_multitask_learning.png)

Tasks were evaluated by using `n-1` tasks where `n` was the number of tasks that we had examples for. We then fine-tune on the final task and evaluate the model performance. Key takeaways were that in general multi-task training underperforms pre-training followed by fine-tuning. The theory is that this results in the model not having seen enough unlabelled data to learn general-purpose language capabilities.

#### Repeating Data

In a data constrained environment, how many times can the model see the same data before it overfits?

![T5 Data](/t5_data_overfit.png)

As expected, performance degrades as the data set size shrinks. We suspect this may be due to the fact that the model begins to memorize the pre-training data set. This suggests that some amount of repetition of pre-training data might not be harmful.

This can be seen by the trainig loss below where repeating the dataset more times results in the model effectively memorizing the data since the train loss decreases significantly.

## Tasks 

They chose a few tasks for benchmarking the model and utilise a given `prefix` in order to get the model to perform specific tasks.

![/t5_text_to_text.png](/t5_text_to_text.png)

We can see that certain prefixes such as 

- `summarize`
- `stsb`

are used to help condition the final text generation output of the model itself. This is why the model is known as a text to text model. 

The specific tasks that were chosen to benchmark the model were 

1. `Sentence Acceptability`
2. `Sentiment Analysis`
3. `Paraphrasing/Sentence Similarity`
4. `Natural Language Inference`
5. `Coreference Resolution`

and others

## Model Implementation 

### Attention Mask

![t5_text_to_text.png](/t5_attention_masks.png)

Instead of using a causal mask, we use fully-visible masking during the prefix portion of the sequence. This allows for the model to better understand the task at hand.
